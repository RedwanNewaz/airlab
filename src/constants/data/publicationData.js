    "abstract": "The framework of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) offers a standard approach to model uncertainty in many robot tasks. Traditionally, POMDPs are formulated with optimality objectives. In this article, we study a different formulation of POMDPs with Boolean objectives . For robotic domains that require a correctness guarantee of accomplishing tasks, Boolean objectives are natural formulations. We investigate the problem of POMDPs with a common Boolean objective: safe reachability , requiring that the robot eventually reaches a goal state with a probability above a threshold while keeping the probability of visiting unsafe states below a different threshold. Our approach builds upon the previous work that represents POMDPs with Boolean objectives using symbolic constraints. We employ a satisfiability modulo theories (SMTs) solver to efficiently search for solutions, i.e., policies or conditional plans that specify the action to take contingent on every possible event. A full policy or conditional plan is generally expensive to compute. To improve computational efficiency, we introduce the notion of partial conditional plans that cover sampled events to approximate a full conditional plan. Our approach constructs a partial conditional plan parameterized by a replanning probability . We prove that the failure rate of the constructed partial conditional plan is bounded by the replanning probability. Our approach allows users to specify an appropriate bound on the replanning probability to balance efficiency and correctness. Moreover, we update this bound properly to quickly detect whether the current partial conditional plan meets the bound and avoid unnecessary computation. In addition, to further improve the efficiency, we cache partial conditional plans for sampled belief states and reuse these cached plans if possible. We validate our approach in several robotic domains. The results show that our approach outperforms a previous policy synthesis approach for POMDPs with safe-reachability objectives in these domains. Note to Practitioners —This article was motivated by two observations. On the one hand, in robotics applications where uncertainty in sensing and actions is present, the solution to the classical partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) formulation is expensive to compute in general. On the other hand, in certain practical scenarios, formulations other than the classical POMDP make a lot of sense and can provide flexibility in balancing efficiency and correctness. This article considers a modified POMDP formulation that includes a Boolean objective, namely safe reachability. This article uses the notion of a partial conditional plan. Rather than explicitly enumerating all possible observations to construct a full conditional plan, this work samples a subset of all observations to ensure bounded replanning probability. Our theoretical and empirical results show that the failure rate of the constructed partial conditional plan is bounded by the replanning probability. Moreover, these partial conditional plans can be cached to further improve the performance. Our results suggest that for domains where replanning is easy, increasing the replanning probability bound usually leads to better scalability, and for domains where replanning is difficult or impossible in some states, we can decrease the bound and allocate more computation time to achieve a higher success rate. Hence, in certain cases, the practitioner can take advantage of their knowledge of the problem domain to scale to larger problems. Preliminary physical experiments suggest that this approach is applicable to real-world robotic domains, but it requires a discrete representation of the workspace. How to deal with continuous workspace directly is an interesting future direction."

    "abstract": "There has been significant interest in recent years in the utility and implementation of autonomous underwater and surface vehicles (AUVs and ASVs) for persistent surveillance of the ocean. Example studies include the dynamics of physical phenomena, e.g., ocean fronts, temperature and salinity profiles, and the onset of harmful algae blooms. For these studies, AUVs are presented with a complex planning and navigation problem to achieve autonomy lasting days and weeks under uncertainties while dealing with resource constraints. We address these issues by adopting motion, sensing, and environment uncertainties via a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. We propose a methodology with a novel extension of POMDPs to incorporate spatiotemporally-varying ocean currents as energy and dynamic obstacles as environment uncertainty. Existing POMDP solutions such as the Cost-Constrained Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planner (POMCP) do not account for energy efficiency. Therefore, we present a scalable Energy Cost-Constrained POMCP algorithm utilizing the predicted ocean dynamics that optimizes energy and environment costs along with goal-driven rewards. A theoretical analysis, along with simulation and real-world experiment results is presented to validate the proposed methodology."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the multi-robot planning problem to generate trajectories for maximum information gathering from an area of interest. To solve this problem, the proposed framework first leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as prior knowledge for modeling informative regions in the target area. Taking samples from the GMM, informative robot paths are then computed that optimize the travel costs subject to energy budgets. Decomposing these paths into waypoints, robot trajectories are planned while respecting kinematic constraints and subsequently replanned online to avoid collisions among themselves. The GMM model is incrementally updated by incorporating the gathered information. We demonstrate that our framework can achieve a significant amount of information gain with the optimal travel distance. We also provide a realistic simulation with a team of mobile robots in a port infrastructure monitoring setting."

Such planning integration is susceptible to uncertainties and computationally challenging as low-level actions should be verified for high-level tasks. Therefore, this paper presents a hierarchical task and motion planning method under uncertainties. We utilize Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to model task and motion planning in a stochastic environment. The motion planner handles motion uncertainty and leverages physical constraints to synthesize an optimal low-level control policy for a single robot to generate motions in continuous action and state spaces. Given the optimal control policy for multiple homogeneous robots, the task planner synthesizes an optimal high-level tasking policy in discrete task and state spaces addressing both task and motion uncertainties. Our optimal tasking and control policies are synthesized through deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The performance of our method is validated in realistic physics-based simulations with two quadrotors transporting objects in a warehouse setting."

    "abstract": "Multi-robot task allocation is a practical way to identify synergies between robots. When all the robots within a system fall under the auspices and authority of a single organization, they can simply be compelled to share their information and participate in cooperative protocols. But when, for instance, they are rivals vying in the marketplace, their own private data may be copyrighted or sensitive, so that disclosing information may erode a competitive advantage. Yet, even limited cooperation, by offering some arbitrage of common resources (such as shared infrastructure), often reduces costs for all parties; indeed, competition and cooperation are not mutually exclusive. We examine the question of how to allocate robots to tasks optimally while ensuring that no task valuations, utilities, positions, or related data are released. We do this via an auction-based assignment algorithm implemented using secure multi-party computation operations, without requiring any trusted auctioneer. The approach offers precise and effective privacy guarantees that are stronger than present methods. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach via tests in a case study inspired by autonomous driving. First, we tested the approach in a single-computer setup, using parties with virtual network interfaces, where we studied the effects of varying the number of parties and the associated parameters of the auction. Next, we tested the approach in a decentralized, physical test-bed using single board computers running over a WiFi LAN network. Finally, we conducted a small proof-of-concept experiment using two autonomous mobile robots performing a decentralized, private auction."

To deal with the challenges associated with the autonomous driving scenarios, an integrated tracking and detection framework is proposed. The detection phase is performed by converting LiDAR streams to computationally tractable depth images, and then, a deep neural network is developed to identify pedestrian candidates both in RGB and depth images. To provide accurate information, the detection phase is further enhanced by fusing multi-modal sensor information using the Kalman filter. The tracking phase is a combination of the Kalman filter prediction and an optical flow algorithm to track multiple pedestrians in a scene. We evaluate our framework on a real public driving dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant performance improvement over a baseline method that solely uses image-based pedestrian detection."

    "abstract": "Network fusion has been recently explored as an approach for improving pedestrian detection performance. However, most existing fusion methods suffer from runtime efficiency, modularity, scalability, and maintainability due to the complex structure of the entire fused models, their end-to-end training requirements, and sequential fusion process. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes a novel fusion framework that combines asymmetric inferences from object detectors and semantic segmentation networks for jointly detecting multiple pedestrians. This is achieved by introducing a consensus-based scoring method that fuses pair-wise pixel-relevant information from the object detector and the semantic segmentation network to boost the final confidence scores. The parallel implementation of the object detection and semantic segmentation networks in the proposed framework entails a low runtime overhead. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed fusion framework are extensively evaluated by fusing different state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors and semantic segmentation networks on a public dataset. The generalization of fused models is also examined on new cross pedestrian data collected through an autonomous car. Results show that the proposed fusion method significantly improves detection performance while achieving competitive runtime efficiency."

    "abstract": "Autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) navigation in marine environments is challenging due to the disturbances caused by water currents and their spatiotemporal variations. Existing methods take into account only spatial variations of vector fields that are measured through vehicle sensors, but neglect temporal variations of vector fields. Effective path planning for ASVs also requires critical reasoning about the prediction of spatiotemporally varying water currents in marine environments. Therefore, this paper presents a method that integrates the prediction of water vector fields with a randomized path planner. We model the water flow of an area of interest as an unknown vector field and then train a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to learn such an unknown vector field accurately and effectively from real ocean current data. This allows the generation of a randomized path that moves along the vector field in a continuous space. To generate a randomized path on the predicted vector field, we present a Deep Vector Field - Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (DVF-RRT) algorithm for reaching a goal configuration starting from an initial configuration that leverages the strength of the RRT algorithm. The algorithm is validated through simulated randomized paths on predictive vector fields and benchmarking with regard to an existing VF-RRT method."

    "abstract": "We present an incremental scalable motion planning algorithm for finding maximally informative trajectories for decentralized mobile robots. These robots are deployed to observe an unknown spatial field, where the informativeness of observations is specified as a density function. Existing works that are typically restricted to discrete domains and synchronous planning often scale poorly depending on the size of the problem. Our goal is to design a distributed control law in continuous domains and an asynchronous communication strategy to guide a team of cooperative robots to visit the most informative locations within a limited mission duration. Our proposed Asynchronous Information Gathering with Bayesian Optimization (AsyncIGBO) algorithm extends ideas from asynchronous Bayesian Optimization (BO) to efficiently sample from a density function. It then combines them with decentralized reactive motion planning techniques to achieve efficient multi-robot information gathering activities. We provide a theoretical justification for our algorithm by deriving an asymptotic no-regret analysis with respect to a known spatial field. Our proposed algorithm is extensively validated through simulation and real-world experiment results with multiple robots."

    "abstract": "Reliable autonomous robot navigation in dynamic environments with external disturbances remains challenging. The Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) generates collision-free trajectories by optimizing over sensor observations and motion constraints. However, the DWA lacks the ability to account for unpredictable disturbances, making robot navigation unreliable. We propose an enhanced planning and control approach that incorporates learned disturbance models to improve adaptability. Our key idea is to represent disturbances as parametric vector fields. By learning the vector field online, we capture environmental flows to be leveraged during planning. We integrate the learned model into the DWA objective to generate optimized trajectories through disturbance flows while avoiding obstacles. The proposed adaptive planning framework is validated in simulations and real-world experiments with ground and aquatic robots. Different case studies demonstrate the approach's ability to produce smooth, collision-free robot navigation in varied disturbance fields and environments. Compared to the standard DWA, our planner handles uncertainties and changing conditions better by learning online. Thus, this disturbance-incorporated planning enables more reliable autonomous navigation in uncertain, dynamic environments."

    "abstract": "Patrolling an adversarial environment with multiple robots equipped with vision sensors poses challenges, such as the potential for wireless communication jamming and limited visibility ranges. Early methods relying on deterministic paths are susceptible to predictability by adversaries. Conversely, recent non-deterministic approaches work in discrete environments but overlook sensor footprints and require synchronization. Therefore, this paper proposes an approach to compute patrolling policies for multiple distributed robots that monitor any polygonal environment leveraging limited unidirectional visibility regions in a continuous space and randomized patrolling paths. A visibility roadmap graph is initially constructed from a given environment through its recursive decomposition to account for unidirectional visibility. Our proposed multi-robot task allocation method then partitions the constructed visibility roadmap graph into a set of disjoint subgraphs (areas) and allocates them to multiple robots. Distributed randomized patrolling policies are finally computed in the form of Markov chains, utilizing convex optimization to minimize the average expected commute times for all pairs of locations in allocated areas. We present multiple simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our visibility-based randomized patrolling approach. We also analyze the performance of our approach in detecting targets by robots through a series of simulation runs while they follow the computed policies during patrolling."

Existing fiducial marker methods rely on handcrafted feature extraction, which sacrifices accuracy. On the other hand, deep learning pipelines for marker detection fail to meet real-time runtime constraints crucial for navigation applications. In this work, we propose YoloTag \\textemdash a real-time fiducial marker-based localization system. YoloTag uses a lightweight YOLO v8 object detector to accurately detect fiducial markers in images while meeting the runtime constraints needed for navigation. The detected markers are then used by an efficient perspective-n-point algorithm to estimate UAV states. However, this localization system introduces noise, causing instability in trajectory tracking. To suppress noise, we design a higher-order Butterworth filter that effectively eliminates noise through frequency domain analysis. We evaluate our algorithm through real-robot experiments in an indoor environment, comparing the trajectory tracking performance of our method against other approaches in terms of several distance metrics."

    "abstract": "Effective data collection in collaborative information-gathering systems relies heavily on maintaining uninterrupted connectivity. Yet, real-world communication disruptions often pose challenges to information-gathering processes. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method —a limited communication decentralized information gathering system for multiple robots to explore environmental phenomena characterized as unknown spatial fields. Our method leverages quadtree structures to ensure comprehensive workspace coverage and efficient exploration. Unlike traditional systems that depend on global and synchronous communication, our method enables robots to share local experiences within a limited transmission range and coordinate their tasks through pairwise and asynchronous communication. Information estimation is facilitated by a Gaussian Process with an Attentive Kernel, allowing adaptive capturing of crucial behavior and data patterns. Our proposed system is validated through simulated scalar field studies in non-stationary environments where multiple robots explore spatial fields. Theoretical guarantees ensure the convergence of distributed area coverage and the regret bounds of distributed online scalar field mapping. We also validate our method empirically in a water quality monitoring scenario featuring three Autonomous Surface Vehicles, tasked with constructing a spatial field."
